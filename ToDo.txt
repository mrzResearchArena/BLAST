Error: When the input cores is greatter than computer cores.

Drawbacks:
1. Usually the number of core is usually limited, this process is highly depent of computing power.
2. It might deadlock because each core are using the same database.
3. Theoritically, the run time is good but in the empirical world, we could not get the same run time what we expected in theoritically.
